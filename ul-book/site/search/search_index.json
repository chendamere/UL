Data Struture","text":"<p>UL as a programming language assumes a specific kind of graph as its data-strucuture, understanding the data-strucuture will help with understanding what proofs entail. The data-strucuture constist of non-intersecting cyclical graphs with exactly one unique null node for each cycle. Each node contains an unique-id, a value, as well as edges that points to the next,  the previous, and the child node associate with the node. </p>"},{"location":"#2-syntax","title":"2.

Expression and Rule","text":"<p>An expression is a sequence of operations, a rule is a statement consists of two expressions. The formal system part of UL consists of a set of definitions, axioms, and deduction rules. In UL, every statement is also a rule, a rule is an equivalence relation. Intuively, every statement in Ul has the form \"'code A' is equivalent to 'code B'\". </p> <p>There are 3 ways to produce new statements. The first two follows from the properties of equivalence relation (commutativity and transitivity). The last one, the insertion rule, allows new statements to be formed if all previous and subsequent subexpressions of the new expressions are the same. </p> <p>When generating statements with deduction rule, operands appearing in the statements are bounded within the statement, but treated as arbiturary when applied in the deduction steps. Meaning the statements \",1 #3 2, &lt;&gt;, 3 #3 4,\" and \",2 #3 3, &lt;&gt;, 4 #3 5,\" are the same.</p>"},{"location":"#4-axioms","title":"4. Axioms","text":"<p>Axioms are rules we accept in the language as truths. They are rules that reflect the basic properties of the primitive operations, and should be consistent with common programming patterns. </p> <p>The first set of axiom describe commutative properties between all primitive operation pairs. Generally, it is true when two primitive operations operates on distinct operands, the operations have no effect on one another. From this result we can assume that if we assume distinct operands, when defining a new sequence of operations, there exist a commutative rule between the sequence and all other operators.</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":"<p>test test</p>"}]}
